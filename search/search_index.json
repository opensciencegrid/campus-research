This server is a CentOS7 VM with \nsingularity that can be used to build EL6 versions of software. The \nrepositories are associated with a respective user, e.g. \n\nspt.opensciencegrid.org\n has an \nspt\n user, that are typically accessible to \nthe relevant members of the experiments.  The VM is fairly large with 8 cores \nand 16 GB RAM. The \n/cvmfs\n directory is a separate disk that can be resized \nif need be.\n\n\nModules\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe modules are hosted out of the \nconnect.opensciencegrid.org\n subrepo. They\nare setup using \nspack\n. A good place to start understanding \nspack is the spack tutuorial available \n\nhere\n. There is a \n\nfork of spack in the OSG Connect GitHub\n \nwhich contains a few necessary changes and additional packages. The main change \nrequired for OSG is that CentOS instances are considered the same as RHEL or \nSL. This is an artifact from using the python \nplatform\n package.\n\n\nPath Structure\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe structure for the software is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n/cvmfs/connect.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n \nmodules\n - Main directory\n\n \nspack\n - Spack instances\n\n \npackages\n - Where individual packages are installed\n\n* \nmodulefiles\n - Where lmod files are located\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are some important spack config files that may need adjusting over time, \nesp. when trying to reconfigure the module structure or adding new \nfeatures:\n\n\nSPACK_ROOT=/cvmfs/connect.opensciencegrid.org/modules/spack\n\n\n\n\n$HOME/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml\n\n\n\n\nThis defines the compilers that can be used by spack. We currently list two \ncompilers by default here: GCC 4.8.5 installed using spack and GCC 6.4.0 also\ninstalled using spack. We had to install GCC 4.8.5 (system compiler for EL7) \nbecause certain programs, e.g. R, require \nlibgfortran\n to be present to run. \nThis is not guaranteed on OSG since some nodes do not have any development \ntools installed. GCC 6.4.0 is needed for support for C++14. \n\n\n\n\n$SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/config.yaml\n\n\n\n\nDefines global configuration parameters for spack. In our case this is just \n\nwhere\n the packages will installed (\ninstall_tree\n) and \nwhere\n the module\nfiles will be located (\nmodule_roots/lmod\n).

On the CVMFS origin host, log \nin as the \nconnect\n user. Now start a CVMFS transaction:\n\n\ncvmfs_server transaction connect.opensciencegrid.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that only a single transaction can be open at a time, so if you \ndon't finish the transaction (for example building ROOT takes hours) no one \nelse can add new modules while a transaction is active. \n\n\nOnce the transaction has been started, go to the spack \nbin\n directory, \n\n$SPACK_ROOT/bin/\n:\n\n\ncd /cvmfs/connect.opensciencegrid.org/modules/spack/bin\n\n\nIf the desired piece of software and version is available in the (spack\npackage list)[https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package_list.html], simply \nrun\n\n\nspack install <package>@<version>%gcc@<gcc_version>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check what \n<gcc_version>\ns are available see \n\n$HOME/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml\n\n\nAdding a new version of a piece of software requires editing the respective \npackage file using\n\n\nspack edit <package>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a new package is fairly straightforward as well. Simply run\n\n\nspack create <url_to_package_tarball>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand edit the resulting file as needed, e.g. add dependencies, add \nconfigure/cmake options, etc. For examples check out various other packages in \n\n$SPACK_ROOT/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/\n.\n\n\nExperiments\n\u00b6\n\n\nSPT\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee Midscale-Engagements\n\n\nXENON\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee Midscale-Engagements\n\n\nVERITAS\n\u00b6\n\n\nSee Midscale-Engagements\n\n\nnEXO\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe nEXO repository is handled by OSG personnel.

Standard response    Thank you for your application for an OSG Connect account. In order to understand your computational research goals and ensure that you get the most out of the Open Science Grid, we schedule a brief meeting as part of the account approval process.  See my calendar for my availability (XXXXXXXX - note my XX time zone), and let me know what time would work well for you to meet. Our discussion should take between 30 - 45 minutes, and I can provide a teleconference link, unless you have a more preferable option.  Additionally, we can streamline the upstart process by associating your account with an OSG Connect 'project'.

It is based on the \n\nGlobus SDK\n, the \n\nGlobus SDK-based Globus Nexus Client\n, \nand puppet/hiera to create and manage UNIX users and groups. The main tasks of \nthese classes and scripts are to interact with the GlobusID and Globus Groups \ndatabase through their RESTful API and manage the JSON file that \npuppet/hiera requires for creating and managing user accounts. \n\n\nThe original GOSync is based on the \n\nGlobus Nexus Python library\n. \nThe Globus Nexus Python library has been officially deprecated. An improved \nversion of the original GOSync, i.e. GOSync2, was under development. It was \nstill based on the Globus Nexus Python library. The development was abandoned \nas Globus has moved to a OAuth2-based authentication model and access to a \nuser's GlobusID.\n\n\nImportant notes READ BEFORE USING:\n\n\n\n\nThis is a BETA. It does not have all the necessary features to act as a full \nreplacement yet.\n\n\nThis version uses Globus Nexus client based on the Globus SDK created by \nStephen Rosen. This is not an official product of the Globus team. It is \nmaintained though.\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\u00b6\n\n\nFollowing assumptions are made in the code:\n\n\n\n\nAll users are part of the \nconnect\n Globus Group\n\n\nThe \nconnect\n user is an \nadmin\n or \nmanager\n in all relevant groups\n\n\n\n\nWork flow\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe GOSync3 work flow is meant to operate without human intervention, i.e. as a \n\ncron\n job, besides the normal user approval process. At the moment, there is \nno connection between account applications and GOSync3. Hence, there is no way \nof knowing which user is new, updated his/her profile, or changed their group \nmembership. This should change in the future, see the last section for details.\n\n\nIn the current work flow, GOSync3 retrieves all groups in which the \nconnect\n \nuser is an \nAdministrator\n or \nManager\n. The \nconnect\n user acts like the root \nuser in a UNIX operating system. In addition to the group name and the UUID \nassigned by Globus Groups, the number of active members is being fetched by \nquerying the group's summary from Globus.  \n\n\nFor creating and updating users the work flow is more complicated. First, \nGOSync3 retrieves all users and their profile associated with the root group, \ni.e. \nconnect\n. It is necessary to fetch the user profile because it contains \nthe user's SSH key. To determine the the user's group membership, the the group \nto users mapping is generated by looping through all groups getting their group \nmembers. FRom this mapping a user to groups mapping is generated. With the \nnecessary information in hand, it the user information in the JSON object is \ncreated or updated.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\u00b6\n\n\nGOSync3 requires at least Python 2.7 and Python packages:\n\n\nglobus\n-\nsdk\n[\njwt\n]>=\n1.0\n,\n<\n2.0\n\n\nglobus\n-\nnexus\n-\nclient\n>=\n0.2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nglobus-sdk[jwt]>=1.0,<2.0\n is the Globus SDK including the \n\nJSON Web Token (JWT)\n library. JWT is necessary to interact \nwith Globus Auth and be able to do token introspection. \n\nglobus-nexus-client>=0.2.5\n is an implementation of the Nexus client using the \nGlobus SDK. It is not an official Globus product, but supported by one of the \nauthors (Stephen Rosen) of the Globus SDK.\n\n\nIn addition to the Python packages, one will need a Globus Confidential \napplication, see \nhere\n for \ndetails, that:\n\n\n\n\nIncludes the user-granted permissions (\"scopes\"):\n\n\nopenid\n\n\nprofile\n\n\nemail\n\n\nurn:globus:auth:scope:auth.globus.org:view_identity_set\n\n\nurn:globus:auth:scope:auth.globus.org:view_identities\n\n\nurn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all\n\n\nurn:globus:auth:scope:auth.globus.org:view_ssh_public_keys\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs allowed to use the Group scopes.

If you want to increase the \nverbosity, default the program will not print out anything to screen, simply \nadd the \n-v\n flag. To increase the verbosity, just add more \nv\ns, i.e. \n-vvvv\n.\n\n\nAdding Group - \nadd_connect_group.py\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo add a group to Globus Groups requires, a file formatted as provided by the \nOSG Connect Website, details below. With the groups project file, a group is \nadded through executing \n\n./add_connect_group.py --projectfile /path/to/file --parent <parent_group>\n. \nThe \n--parent <parent_group>\n is optional, but necessary to maintain the group \ntree structure and determine the correct group name in Globus. To pass your own \nconfiguration you will need to the \n--config /path/to/new/config\n option. There \nis also a verbosity flag, i.e. \n-v\n, \n-vv\n, and \n-vvv\n. \n\n\nGlobus Interface - \nglobus_db.py\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe class \nglobus_db\n is meant as an interface to the Globus ID and Globus \nGroups services. Please note that being able to \nPUT\n and \nPUSH\n information \ninto Globus Groups is possible through the Nexus interface. Currently, only \nthe \nPUT\n for Globus Groups is supported.\n\n\nThe class requires a configuration dictionary and an \nconnect_db\n object. The \nconfiguration dictionary is explained above. The \nconnect_db\n is needed to \nretrieve the the refresh tokens for users and allow of to check for changes \nin group membership, i.e. if users were added or removed from a group.\n\n\nThe class is split into four sections: client methods, group methods, group \nmembership methods, and user methods.\n\n\nClient Methods and some explanation about various Globus tokens\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe client methods are for getting the different types of clients needed to \ninteract with GlobusID through Globus Auth and Globus Groups through Globus \nNexus. There are two main clients used: Globus Auth client and Globus Nexus \nclient. The Globus Auth client is for interacting with the user's GlobusID, i.e \nget the user profile in GlobusID. The Globus Nexus client is for interacting \nwith a user's Globus Groups and their Globus Groups's profile.\n\n\nThe clients can be authenticated using Globus Auth tokens or Globus Online Auth \nlegacy tokens. Tokens can be thought of as randomly generated passwords that \nencode the user's identity and the application's permission level. Globus \nOnline Auth legacy tokens will be referred to as legacy tokens from here on \nout. Legacy tokens should be avoided at all cost. They may not work down the \nroad and are bad practice.\n\n\nGlobus Auth tokens are OAuth2 tokens. OAuth2 gives the user and the \nauthorization server the explicit power to reject or limit (either in time or \nscope) an application's access, to the user's information. It also moves large \nparts of the authentication process from the resource provider to an \nauthentication provider, which allows for better separation between resources \nand authentication. For more details please visit \n\nAn introduction to OAuth2\n. \n\n\nThe Globus Auth tokens are split into three different types: Auth, Transfer, \nand Nexus. One will receive one, two, or all three, when a user authenticates \nagainst the app depending on an app's scopes, i.e. requested permissions. With \nthe app created in the prerequisites one will receive all three tokens. Auth \ntokens are meant for retrieving a user's information from Globus ID, i.e. \nlinked identities, SSH keys, etc. Transfer tokens are for initiating Globus \ntransfers on behalf of the user. Nexus tokens are for authorizing against the \nGlobus Groups service to allow viewing a user's group membership. The Nexus \ntokens do not allow to view a user's Globus groups profile through a call to \nthe user's Globus Nexus profile, i.e. the group-specific custom fields and the \nuser identity, directly. This due to the Nexus group scope not having the \npermissions to view the user's GlobusID. This can be circumvented by through \naccessing the profile through the groups interface instead. I know... Please \nnote that Nexus tokens are special. They are not officially available, one \nhas to request access to the \"group\" scopes from Globus. \n\n\nGlobus Auth tokens expire after some time, usually within 10 minutes, i.e. you \nas the application only have a limited amount of time to retrieve the desired \ninformation out of Globus. To be able to repeatedly authenticate with Globus \nAuth, one can request \"refresh tokens\". These tokens are valid until the user \nrevokes an app's permission. These are required for GOSync3.\n\n\nThe individual methods are self-explanatory:\n\n\n\n\nget_tokens\n: Returns a user's tokens from the \nconnect_db\n or retrieves \nthe tokens from the configuration file for the root user.\n\n\nget_legacy_client\n: Returns a user's Nexus client that has been \nauthenticated using legacy Globus Online Auth token, i.e. the \nuser's username/password.\n\n\nget_globus_client\n: Returns the user's Globus Auth and Globus Nexus client \nauthenticated using the user's refresh tokens. \n\n\n\n\nGroup Methods\n\u00b6\n\n\nRetrieving Group Infomation - \nGET\n Methods\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are two ways to access all groups associated with \nconnect\n. The first is \nto the retrieve the group tree for the root group, named \nconnect\n. The second \nis to retrieve all groups associated with the root user, also named \nconnect\n. \n\n\nIn GOSyn3, we are using the second method. There is a method to retrieve the \ngroup tree, but it is unused at the moment. The \nget_group\n and \nget_groups\n \nmethod simply filter the \nall_groups\n list for the desired group(s). \n\nget_all_groups\n is the method that uses the root user's credentials to \ndetermine groups in which the root user, \nconnect\n, is an \nadmin\n or \nmanager\n. \nThe distinction between between being \nadmin\n, \nmanager\n, or \nmember\n is \nimportant here. It filters the groups that are returned by Globus Nexus. The \n\nconnect\n user will always be an \nadmin\n or \nmanager\n in a subgroup, while a \nuser might be a \nadmin\n, \nmanager\n, or \nmember\n. The root user is a \nmember\n \nof some groups that are not associated with the Connect instances. \n\n\nIn addition there is a \ncheck_new_members\n methods at is currently used. It \nallows to filter the group list to those groups that have recently added members. \n\n\nAdding Group Information - \nPOST\n Methods\n\u00b6\n\n\nGOSync3 has the ability to add groups to Globus Groups. This is done through \nthe \nadd_group\n and \nparse_project_file\n methods. Adding a group is done \nthrough the \nadd_groups\n method. It calls the \nglobus-nexus-client\n's \n\ncreate_group\n method to create the group with name and description provided \nthrough the project description text file, details on this below. Optionally, \none can pass a parent group to the method. It is strongly recommended to \nprovide a parent group, without a group the group will be assumed to be a \ntop-level group below the root \nconnect\n group. \n\n\nThe project description text file should follow the format of the form on the \n\nNew Project section on the OSG Connect website\n. \nThis will provide a text file of the following format:\n\n\nYour Name: \n\n\nYour Email Address: \n\n\nProject Name: \n\n\nShort Project Name: \n\n\nField of Science: Evolutionary \n\n\nField of Science (if Other): \n\n\nPI Name: \n\n\nPI Email:\n\n\nPI Organization:\n\n\nPI Department:\n\n\nJoin Date: \n\n\nSponsor: \n\n\nOSG Sponsor Contact: \n\n\nProject Contact: \n\n\nProject Contact Email: \n\n\nTelephone Number: \n\n\nProject Description:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this the only required field is the \"Short Project Name\". The value will \nbe used as the group name in Globus Groups. \n\n\nparse_project_file\n parses the project file, determines the expected name of \nthe group, and converts the plain text to HTML-formatted text. The project name \nis determined from the \"Short Project Name\" in the project file and the parent \ngroup. The format of the Globus Groups name is \n\n<parent_group>.<short_project_name\n. To make the text HTML-formatted, the \nonly action is to converted newline characters (\n\\n\n) to \n<br>\n.\n\n\nGroup Membership Methods\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe work flow for retrieving a user's group membership depends on the \nauthentication method used. In a purely Globus Auth-based workflow, one would \nretrieve a user's group membership by using their tokens and calling \n\nlist_groups\n method from the Nexus client. This is done in the function \n\nget_user_groups_auth\n.\n\n\nAt the moment, we only have tokens for the \nconnect\n user. To work around this, \nGOSync3 tries to generate a mapping of group to users first and then inverts \nthat mapping, see function \nget_user_groups_no_tokens\n. It retrieves the list \nof all groups associated with the \nconnect\n user and then determines the group \nmembers for every group. Using \n_invert_dict_list_values\n, the group-to-users \nmapping is then inverted to the user-to-groups mapping. \n\n\nget_group_members\n simply returns the users for a given group. This has to be \ndone using the group's Globus UUID. A mapping of Globus group name to Globus \ngroup UUID is provided by the \nconnect_db\n.\n\n\nUser Methods\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe user methods allow the user to retrieve more information about user, i.e. \nquery Globus for the user's \"user information\" and manipulate the Globus output \nin a more easily digestible patterns. \n\n\nget_user_info\n is a specialization of \nget_user_groups_profile\n. It allows to \nfetch the a user's profile, i.e. username, SSH key, group-specific information, \nfull name, e-mail, through Globus Groups. \nget_user_info\n is specialization in \nthe sense that it uses the root group user profile rather than specific group's \nprofile as needed by \nget_user_groups_profile\n.\n\n\nget_all_users\n retrieves all the users in the root group and then queries \nGlobus Groups for the user's profile. \n_invert_dict_list_values\n allows you \nto invert the group to users mapping to a user to groups mapping.\n\n\nPuppet/Hiera Interface - \nconnect_db.py\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn this case, the JSON file used by puppet/hiera is used as a user database. \nThis is suboptimal. It will allow us to quickly deploy GOSync3. The information \nsource for the puppet/hiera JSON file can be replaced by a real DB later on. \nSome of the information, i.e. UNIX ids, stored in the JSON file will be needed \nto populate a replacement database.\n\n\nThe puppet/hiera interface, i.e \nconnect_db\n, is a thin layer of the JSON \nobject that puppet/hiera uses to provision user accounts. It reads a previous \nversion of the JSON object, and produces a \nusers\n and \ngroups\n dictionary and \na \nuids\n and \ngids\n list. These four objects contain all the necessary \ninformation to be able add new groups and users to the JSON object passed \nto puppet/hiera.\n\n\nThe \nusers\n and \ngroups\n dictionaries are made up of sub-dictionaries. Holding \nthe information for each user and group, respectively. The \nusers\n dictionary \nis a mapping of username to user information, such that:\n\n\n{\n\n\n    \"auth_refresh_token\": # user's Globus Auth refresh token\n\n\n    \"comment\": # user's name\n\n\n    \"email\": # user's emails\n\n\n    \"gid\": # default group for passwd file\n\n\n    \"manage_group\": # puppet/hiera config parameter\n\n\n    \"nexus_refresh_token\": # user's Globus Nexus refresh token\n\n\n    \"shell\": # default user shell\n\n\n    \"ssh_keys\": # SSH key dictionary, explained below\n\n\n    \"uid\": # user's UNIX id\n\n\n    \"groups\": # list of user's groups,\n\n\n    \"connect_project\":  # Initial connect project, typically osg.ConnectTrain\n\n\n    \"condor_schedd\": # The condor schedd to pick on the login host\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \ngroups\n dictionary follows a similar pattern. Mapping a group name to:\n\n\n{\n\n\n    \"gid\": # group UNIX ID\n\n\n    \"num_members\": # Number if active user according to Globus\n\n\n    \"globus_uuid\": # Groups Globus UUID\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the methods in this class are self-explanatory:\n\n\n\n\nadd_group\n: Add a new group to the \ngroups\n dictionary\n\n\nadd_user\n: Add a new user to the \nusers\n dictionary\n\n\nget_user\n: Retrieve the user information by username\n\n\nget_group\n: Retrieve the group by group name\n\n\nnew_unix_id\n: This will generate a new UNIX id by incrementing the maximum \nID or setting it to 100000 for both groups and users\n\n\nget_member_count\n: Retrieve the group's active member count\n\n\nget_auth_token\n: Retrieve user's Globus Auth refresh token\n\n\nget_nexus_token\n: Retrieve user's Globus Nexus refresh token\n\n\nget_globus_tokens\n: Retrieves user's Globus Auth and Nexus refresh tokens\n\n\nremove_unicode\n: Remove unicode characters from a user's name. This can \ncause problems when generating a passwd file or trying to serialize a JSON file.\n\n\ncommit_old_version\n: In the spirit of old GOSync, we commit the JSON file to \nGitlab, so puppet/hiera can grab it from there\n\n\nwrite_db\n: Write the JSON object out. If \nemail_file\n is supplied in the \nconfig, it will also create a directory with json files that maps the group \nusers to their email addresses. Similarly, if \nmailchimp_file\n is supplied, \nit will also create a directory with json files that maps the group users to \ntheir information needed for mailchimp. \n\n\nset_user_nologin\n: Set a user's shell to nologin, used in case they are no \nlonger \"active\" in a Globus group\n\n\nget_emails\n: Get email for everyone or optionally for a given group\n\n\nget_email\n: Get email for a specific user\n\n\nget_mailchimp_info\n: Gather information about users for mailchimp. Mapping \nusers to their, first name, last name, and email address.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nget_default_project\n method is tries to guess a user's first OSG project \nfor account reasons. If the user is a member of more than more than one \nsub-project we need to filter out any of the default ones. First, \n\"osg.ConnectTrain\" is removed. If there are still more than one projects, we \nfilter out any project associated with a user school and any OSG project, if the\n user is a member of the other connect instances, i.e. SPT, ATLAS, CMS, and Duke. \n\n\nThe \ndecompose_sshkey\n method is necessary because of the format that \npuppet/hiera wants the SSH key in. A typical SSH key is formatted as follows:\n\n\n<encryption_type> <public_key> <idenitifier>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere the \n<encryption_type>\n is the type of SSH key, i.e. ssh-rsa, \n\n<public_key>\n is the actual key portion of an SSH key, and \n<idenitifier>\n is \nan optional identifier that is usually \n<username>@<network_hostname>\n of the \nmachine the key pair was generated on. \n\n\nPuppet/hiera wants the key in this JSON object:\n\n\n{\n\n\n    \"<identifier>\":\n\n\n    {\n\n\n        \"type\": <encryption_type> # Encryption type, i.e. ssh-rsa, ssh-dsa\n\n\n        \"key\": <public_key> # Key part\n\n\n    }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis requires to split the key according to the spaces it in. Unfortunately, \nnot all keys have the identifier. In those cases it is replaced with the user's \nemail address. This will not affect operations. There is a question though \nabout overriding SSH keys. \n\n\nFuture Plans\n\u00b6\n\n\nWork flow Improvements\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere are three slow processes in the current work flow:\n\n\n\n\nGetting the group summary \n\n\nGetting the user summary\n\n\nGetting the user group memberships\n\n\n\n\nThe first processes are slow because we have to query the Globus Groups \ndatabase separately each piece of the group information: group profile, number \nof members, and group members, respectively. In addition, queries on the Globus \nside slow down as the group tree grows in size and as we add more groups the \nmore queries we have to perform. Getting the user summary is a similarly \nexpensive process because we have to query Globus for every user twice, once \nto get their general information, and another to get their SSH key.\n\n\nOne of the main steps to improve the efficiency requires to change the website \nto use OAuth2. This would allow us to operate on a per-user basis rather than \non a per-group basis. In an idealized work flow, a user would sign up on the \nwebsite. This sign up process would trigger the ability to retrieve the users \nidentity (including their SSH key)and their Globus OAuth tokens, see below for \nmore details on Globus OAuth tokens. With the identity and Globus token in \nhand, we can then query Globus for just the new user's group memberships. The \nfirst query would happen be default at sign up, while the group membership \nquery would come after they are approved. The second query may have to be \nrepeated several time. This is not wasted effort though, since we are waiting \nfor human intervention. Similarly, we could trigger a Globus query of a given \nuser's profile once they login. This would make updating the user information \non our end dependent on user actions rather than us having to repeatedly query \nGlobus for their information. Given that we most likely will never have tokens \nfor all users, we will need operate in a hybrid mode, where the new user's are \nhandled solely through the tokens, while older users will have still have to \nbe kept up to date through the above described work flow. \n\n\nPUT\n and \nPUSH\n Methods for Globus Interface\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo create groups in Globus Groups, we will need to implement \nPUSH\n methods. \nThe \nNexusClient\n already has these, but they are untested. I will need to \ntest them before I can sanction them. I also want to standardize all \ninformation that is stored in Globus Groups for all the groups. Currently there \nare several different formats. \n\n\nMoving connect DB to a real DB\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe data volume is not that large and the JSON file is sufficient to store all \nthe information. Down the road, we might want split from Globus and at this \npoint we need to retrieve all the data from Globus. Storing this data would \nneed a database.\n\n\nMultiple Connect Globus Apps\n\u00b6\n\n\nBranded websites in Globus are mapped one-to-one to a specific Globus App. To \nhave different branded website for the various connect instances, we would need \nmultiple Globus Apps. Tokens are app-specific, so for users that are members of \nmultiple connect instances, for example CI Connect and OSG Connect, we will \nneed to keep track of different refresh tokens and apps that they are \nassociated with.",

There are two main clients used: Globus Auth client and Globus Nexus \nclient. The Globus Auth client is for interacting with the user's GlobusID, i.e \nget the user profile in GlobusID. The Globus Nexus client is for interacting \nwith a user's Globus Groups and their Globus Groups's profile.  The clients can be authenticated using Globus Auth tokens or Globus Online Auth \nlegacy tokens. Tokens can be thought of as randomly generated passwords that \nencode the user's identity and the application's permission level. Globus \nOnline Auth legacy tokens will be referred to as legacy tokens from here on \nout. Legacy tokens should be avoided at all cost. They may not work down the \nroad and are bad practice.  Globus Auth tokens are OAuth2 tokens. OAuth2 gives the user and the \nauthorization server the explicit power to reject or limit (either in time or \nscope) an application's access, to the user's information. It also moves large \nparts of the authentication process from the resource provider to an \nauthentication provider, which allows for better separation between resources \nand authentication. For more details please visit  An introduction to OAuth2 .   The Globus Auth tokens are split into three different types: Auth, Transfer, \nand Nexus. One will receive one, two, or all three, when a user authenticates \nagainst the app depending on an app's scopes, i.e. requested permissions. With \nthe app created in the prerequisites one will receive all three tokens. Auth \ntokens are meant for retrieving a user's information from Globus ID, i.e. \nlinked identities, SSH keys, etc. Transfer tokens are for initiating Globus \ntransfers on behalf of the user. Nexus tokens are for authorizing against the \nGlobus Groups service to allow viewing a user's group membership. The Nexus \ntokens do not allow to view a user's Globus groups profile through a call to \nthe user's Globus Nexus profile, i.e. the group-specific custom fields and the \nuser identity, directly. This due to the Nexus group scope not having the \npermissions to view the user's GlobusID. This can be circumvented by through \naccessing the profile through the groups interface instead. I know... Please \nnote that Nexus tokens are special. They are not officially available, one \nhas to request access to the \"group\" scopes from Globus.   Globus Auth tokens expire after some time, usually within 10 minutes, i.e. you \nas the application only have a limited amount of time to retrieve the desired \ninformation out of Globus. To be able to repeatedly authenticate with Globus \nAuth, one can request \"refresh tokens\". These tokens are valid until the user \nrevokes an app's permission. These are required for GOSync3.  The individual methods are self-explanatory:   get_tokens : Returns a user's tokens from the  connect_db  or retrieves \nthe tokens from the configuration file for the root user.  get_legacy_client : Returns a user's Nexus client that has been \nauthenticated using legacy Globus Online Auth token, i.e. the \nuser's username/password.  get_globus_client : Returns the user's Globus Auth and Globus Nexus client \nauthenticated using the user's refresh tokens.",

This can \ncause problems when generating a passwd file or trying to serialize a JSON file.  commit_old_version : In the spirit of old GOSync, we commit the JSON file to \nGitlab, so puppet/hiera can grab it from there  write_db : Write the JSON object out. If  email_file  is supplied in the \nconfig, it will also create a directory with json files that maps the group \nusers to their email addresses. Similarly, if  mailchimp_file  is supplied, \nit will also create a directory with json files that maps the group users to \ntheir information needed for mailchimp.   set_user_nologin : Set a user's shell to nologin, used in case they are no \nlonger \"active\" in a Globus group  get_emails : Get email for everyone or optionally for a given group  get_email : Get email for a specific user  get_mailchimp_info : Gather information about users for mailchimp. Mapping \nusers to their, first name, last name, and email address.   The  get_default_project  method is tries to guess a user's first OSG project \nfor account reasons. If the user is a member of more than more than one \nsub-project we need to filter out any of the default ones. First, \n\"osg.ConnectTrain\" is removed. If there are still more than one projects, we \nfilter out any project associated with a user school and any OSG project, if the\n user is a member of the other connect instances, i.e. SPT, ATLAS, CMS, and Duke.   The  decompose_sshkey  method is necessary because of the format that \npuppet/hiera wants the SSH key in. A typical SSH key is formatted as follows:  <encryption_type> <public_key> <idenitifier>   where the  <encryption_type>  is the type of SSH key, i.e. ssh-rsa,  <public_key>  is the actual key portion of an SSH key, and  <idenitifier>  is \nan optional identifier that is usually  <username>@<network_hostname>  of the \nmachine the key pair was generated on.   Puppet/hiera wants the key in this JSON object:  {      \"<identifier>\":      {          \"type\": <encryption_type> # Encryption type, i.e. ssh-rsa, ssh-dsa          \"key\": <public_key> # Key part      }  }   This requires to split the key according to the spaces it in. Unfortunately, \nnot all keys have the identifier. In those cases it is replaced with the user's \nemail address. This will not affect operations.

In addition, queries on the Globus \nside slow down as the group tree grows in size and as we add more groups the \nmore queries we have to perform. Getting the user summary is a similarly \nexpensive process because we have to query Globus for every user twice, once \nto get their general information, and another to get their SSH key.  One of the main steps to improve the efficiency requires to change the website \nto use OAuth2. This would allow us to operate on a per-user basis rather than \non a per-group basis. In an idealized work flow, a user would sign up on the \nwebsite. This sign up process would trigger the ability to retrieve the users \nidentity (including their SSH key)and their Globus OAuth tokens, see below for \nmore details on Globus OAuth tokens. With the identity and Globus token in \nhand, we can then query Globus for just the new user's group memberships. The \nfirst query would happen be default at sign up, while the group membership \nquery would come after they are approved. The second query may have to be \nrepeated several time. This is not wasted effort though, since we are waiting \nfor human intervention. Similarly, we could trigger a Globus query of a given \nuser's profile once they login. This would make updating the user information \non our end dependent on user actions rather than us having to repeatedly query \nGlobus for their information.

The telescope is expected to collect a \npetabyte (PB) of data over course of five years, which is a significantly \nlarger data volume than any other CMB telescope in operation. The increase \nin data rate required radical changes to the SPT computing model both at the \nSouth Pole and University of Chicago. This paper will describe the overall \nintegration of distributed storage and compute resources into a common \ninterface, deployment of on-site data reduction and storage infrastructure, \nand the usage of the Open Science Grid (OSG) by the SPT collaboration.  Data requirements:   ~ 150-200 TB of compressed raw data coming north every year in big boxes of \nhard drives   ~30 TB/year of reduced-rate data arriving continuously by satellite.
